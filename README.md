# TwitterApp

Git repository for the COM1001 Twitter project. Feel free to contribute :)


Note that you need the following gems installed:

1 - twitter

2 - sinatra

3 - thin

4 - digest

5 - sqlite3

You could also download them using bundler (I've added a Gemfile), but when I tried to 
use bundler it didn't work. You ight as well just try and see if it works first, if not
install these gems manually in the console / terminal.


Rules:

1 - Please post meaningful comments in your commits. 

2 - If you need help with anything feel free to contact me in the Facebook group chat. 

3 - If you don't understand a piece of code in the program, contact the person who wrote the code :)


Have fun!
